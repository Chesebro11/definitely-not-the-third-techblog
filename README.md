# About

This Assignment was to create a Techblog using express-handlebars, and the MVC file Structure. Unfortunately this assignment is incomplete. I honestly could not bring myself to complete an assignment identical to not only an in class assignment, but also the second group project. I found this to be repetitive and needed to spend my time elsewhere catching up on new information I had yet to learn.

However, The backend to the application is functional there is little to no front end intergration which is my weak point. I would have enjoyed an express handlebars assignment that allowed me to focus exclusively on the front end so I could better hone my skills in that area.
